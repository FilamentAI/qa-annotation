# qa-annotation
The Streamlit tool for the Filament Synthetic QA Pairs project, used to annotate generated data. 

## Setup


The tool can be run with the command `run /home/matt/qa-annotation/qa_annotation_tool.py -- --insecure` (we pass the "--insecure" flag since no password file is included in the tool.)
